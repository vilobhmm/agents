Job Application Helper Skill

Helps with job applications: resume tailoring, cover letters, and tracking.

Usage:
  /job-apply "Help me apply to Google ML Engineer role"
  /job-apply "Generate cover letter for TCS Java Developer"
  /job-apply "Tailor my resume for Product Manager at Microsoft"
  /job-apply "What's the status of my Anthropic application?"

This skill invokes the job_hunter agent for application assistance.
