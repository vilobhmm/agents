Job Search Skill for Claude Code

Makes job hunting SUPER EASY with natural language.

Usage:
  /job-search "Find Java Developer at TCS in India with 2-3 years"
  /job-search "Find Software Engineer at Wipro in Bangalore"
  /job-search "Find ML Engineer with Python and PyTorch"
  /job-search "Find remote Product Manager jobs"

This skill directly invokes the job_hunter agent with universal search.
